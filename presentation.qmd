# Why would you care?

- What are the UPPMAX docs?
- **Why would you care?**
- How to contribute?

## Why would you care?

- To (help show) we care about our **users**
- To (help show) we care about **quality**
- To (help show) yourself a good **team player**

## How do we show we care about our users? 1/

We are the only HPC center is Sweden
that has:

- :salt: **no broken links** 
- :salt: **no spelling errors** 

![](badges.png)

## How do we show we care about our users? 2/

We are the only HPC center is Sweden where:

- **users can create issues** for us
- **users can edit pages** easily

![](pelle_compressed_annotated_zoom_on_edit.png)

## How do we show we care about our users? 3/

We are the only HPC center is Sweden that:

- provides an **AI agent**
- allows **anonymous feedback**
  
![](first_page_annotated_zoom_anonymous_feedback.png)

## How do we show we care about quality? 1/

**Dog fooding**: the pages are used:

- as teaching material
- to solve tickets

![](rt_ticket_1.png)

## How do we show we care about quality? 2/

**Every commit is checked**: a Continuous Integration service
allows us to ensure quality:

- Link checker
- Spell checker
- Bash linter
- Markdown linter

![](badges.png)

## How do we show we care about quality? 3/

**No lame excuses**: Because we can access all plain-text pages,
we can use all the power tools, e.g. `grep`, `sed`, `awk`.

```bash
echo "Number of dropdown boxes"
./scripts/count_n_dropdown_boxes.sh

echo "Number of images"
./scripts/count_n_images.sh
```

# Do we do a good job?

How do we know we do a good job?

## What we think

We think we do a good job:

-   We ask in person
-   We hear this in courses
-   We read this in anonymous feedback,
    such as our (public!) course evaluations

# Conclusion

We are the Swedish HPC center that seems to ...

- care most about its **users**
- have the highest **quality** standards
- have the best **team players**
- do a **good job**

# Questions?

Never hesitate to chat about documentation with me :-)
