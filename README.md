- Why would you care?

  - To (help show) we care about our **users**
  - To (help show) we care about **quality**
  - To (help show) yourself a good **team player**

- How do we show we care about our users

  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden
    that has **no broken links** :grain_of_salt:
  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden
    that has **no spelling errors** :grain_of_salt:
  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden where
    **users can edit pages** easily
  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden where
    **users can create issues** for us
  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden that allows
    **anonymous feedback**
  - We are the only HPC center is Sweden that provides an
    **AI agent**

- How do we show we care about quality

  - **Dog fooding**: The pages are used:
    - as teaching material
    - to solve tickets
  - **Every commit is checked**: 
    A Continuous Integration service (GitHub Actions),
    allows us to ensure quality:
    - Link checker
    - Spell checker
    - Markdown linter
  - **No lame excuses**: Because we can access all plain-text pages,
    we can usen all the power tools, e.g. `grep`, `sed`, `awk`

- How to show yourself a good team player

  - By sharing your knowledge
    - I commonly put knowledge from Matrix somewhere in the doc
  - Report mistakes as an issue
  - Fix content
  - Create issues on behalf of users
    `[Jayant issue FileZilla Bianca]`

- Technology stack
  - Version control: git
  - Code hosting: GitHub
  - Continuous integration service: GitHub Actions
  - Markup language: Markdown
  - Static site generator: MkDocs

- Conclusion

  - We are the Swedish HPC center that seems to care most about its **users**
  - We are the Swedish HPC center that seems to have the highest **quality** standards
  - We are the Swedish HPC center that seems to have the best **team players**
